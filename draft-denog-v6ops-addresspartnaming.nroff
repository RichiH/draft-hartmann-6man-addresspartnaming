Abstract

In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and other people
who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessary to refer to
particular parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4, the term "octet" is
well established, however as the use of IPv6 is spreading, it becomes
apparent that there is no such commonly accepted term for IPv6 addresses. 

Discussing and explaining technical matters become difficult when different
people use different terms for the same thing. Therefore, this document
discusses several naming proposal for those 16bit pieces of IPv6 addreses.

1. Introduction

Verbal and written communication requires a common set of terms, easily
understood by every potential party. While deploying IPv6, when refering to
segments of IPv6 addresses, confusion regularly arises due to the usage of
different and sometimes conflicting nomenclature for the same pieces of
information.
  
[IPV6Addr] is the normative reference to IPv6 addressing and avoids to coin
a special term for the subject of this document itself:
.br
.in 6
The preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are one to four
hexadecimal digits of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.

.in 3
[IPv6Rep] is the normative reference to IPv6 address text representation and
introduces the term "16-bit field" or short "field".

.bp

2. Rationale

While we readily agree that the naming of IPv6 address parts is not the most
pressing concern the Internet is facing today, a common nomenclature is
important for efficient communication.
   
In IPv6 deployments the delimiting colons are regularly used to facilitate
the separation of labels discerning not only administrative boundaries but
also network segments and distinct infrastructure components. Consequently
the values between the colons are frequently refered to especially in
communication regarding coordinative matters.

Time spent explaining what one is referring to is wasted and conflicting
names can lead to misunderstanding while the usage of a common term helps
facilitating quick understanding.

To solve this problem, the specification of a precise and recognizable term
is advised.

A typical ambiguity occurs in [IPv6Rep] which uses the term "field" or
"16-bit field" for the term in question. This case is interesting because
there was a short IETF WG discussion which term should be used.

If an IPv6 address field in a certificate was incorrectly verified by
converting it to text ...

.in 3
Since parts of the internet community only accept authoritative advice
substantiated by a published document, also known as the 'citation needed'
approach, it is helpful to have a definite source.

3. Naming Considerations

Any term that can be confused with other technical terms due to phonetic
similarities can lead to misconfiguration causing reachability and security
risks to the involved parties. Even with English being the preferred
language in the IT world today, a good name should describe the technical
matter precisely while being easy to remember, spell and pronounce in as
many languages as possible.

4. Naming Proposals

.ti 0
4.1. Hextet

"Hexadectet" is directly derived from IPv4's "octet", thus technically
correct and convenient to get used to. Because it is harder to pronounce,
the short form "hextet" is used.

"Hextet" SHOULD be the standard term in technical documents refering to IPv6
address parts.

.ti 0
4.2. Quibble

A nibble is a 4bit entity, hence 16 bits are a quad nibble. This is a rather
bulky word, however, so "quibble" is a convenient abbreviation. Also, it is
a unique term in networking and has a similar conotation in ordinary
English.

"Quibble" MIGHT be used for informal communication.

.ti 0
5. Security Considerations

This memo does not directly discuss security issues, however the lack of a
common, well established term could theoretically lead to misinterpretation,
possible leading to insecure configuration of computer systems. 

.ti 0
6. IANA Considerations

No assignments by the IANA are required. However it is considered desirable
that the IANA adopts the term in future documents.

8. Acknowledgements

Thanks go to Greg Ferro who initiated the discussion by proposing the term
"chazwazza".[greg]

Many thanks to all those people which contribute to our work and participate
in the straw poll about all the other propoals, which are described in
former versions of this memo: Chazwazza, Chunk, Column, Colonade, Colonnade,
Doctet, Field, Hexadectet, Hit, Orone, Part, Provider number, customer
number, network number, Quad nibble, qibble, Segment, Tuple, and Word.

The inital version of this document was created following the spirit of
[Q.6].
